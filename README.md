# React Router DOM Routes Component Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a bug I encountered with the `Routes` component in `react-router-dom`.  The application fails to render any components despite seemingly correct route definitions.

## Description
The issue occurs when using `Routes` with nested routes or complex route structures. The application loads, but the expected components do not render, resulting in a blank page.  This is not due to any obvious errors in the component structure or route configurations.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the application renders a blank page, indicating the `Routes` component is not correctly rendering child components.

## Solution
The solution involves refactoring the code to avoid nested routes, or using different routing libraries.
